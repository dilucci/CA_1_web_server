	<h1>The Chat Client</h1>
	<p>Download the chat client as an executable jar file (requires Java). To test the client by yourself, start more than one instance (each with a unique user name)</p>

	<h1>Documentation</h1>
	<p>In this project we did a lot of pair-programming using <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/da/index.aspx">Teamviewer</a> and <a href="http://www.skype.com/da/">Skype</a></p>
	<p>This means that we have all been coding at the same time, on the same thing. Doing pair programming was beneficial for us because we all knew what was coded and where. 
	If we didn't do pair programming, our overall understanding of the code would've been slightly worse, but in the end the work would've been done much faster because of 3 programming instead of 1.</p>
	<p>Our design of the chat-server was to obey the protocol that was given and make sure we used the protocolstrings. We implementet the application, so that whenever a message was received via the inputstream, the client and/or the clienHandler would split the string and do the requested command.</p>
